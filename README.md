ABC Company Employee Data Analysis

Overview
This project analyzes the employee dataset of ABC company, consisting of 458 rows and 9 columns. The dataset provides crucial details about employees such as their age, salary, team, and position within the organization. By performing data preprocessing, exploration, and analysis, the goal is to uncover patterns and provide insights that can help guide decision-making related to workforce management, salary distribution, and team composition.
The analysis covers:

•	Distribution of employees across teams.

•	Segregation of employees based on positions.

•	Predominant age groups among employees.

•	Highest salary expenditure by team and position.

•	Correlation between age and salary.

Visualizations are provided for each task to support data-driven insights.

Preprocessing Steps
Before diving into the analysis, the following preprocessing steps were applied to ensure data consistency and quality:
1.	Correcting the "Height" Column:
o	The "height" column had inconsistencies, so it was replaced with random values between 150 and 180, ensuring that all entries were within a valid range.
2.	Handling Missing Data:
o	Any missing or erroneous data were cleaned or imputed. This ensured that no incomplete records would affect the accuracy of the analysis.
3.	Categorizing Data:
o	Age groups were created by dividing employees into specific age brackets (e.g., 15-20, 20-25, etc.).
o	Positions and teams were used for further segmentation and visualization.
Analysis Tasks and Findings
1. Distribution of Employees Across Teams
   
•	Objective: To analyze how employees are distributed across the 31 teams within the company.

•	Findings:
o	The team with the highest percentage of employees had 4.148% of the total workforce, while the team with the lowest percentage had 3.0567%.

•	Visualization: A pie chart was created to visually show the distribution of employees across each of the 31 teams. This chart highlighted the teams with the most employees, as well as those that are underrepresented.

4. Segregation of Employees by Position
   
•	Objective: To break down employees by their job positions and examine the workforce structure.

•	Findings:

o	SG (Senior Group): 102 employees

o	PF (Professional Group): 100 employees

o	PG (Professional Growth): 92 employees

o	SF (Specialist Group): 85 employees

o	C (Consultants): 79 employees

•	Visualization: A bar chart was used to display the number of employees in each position. This chart provided insights into the composition of various positions, showing the relative size of each group.

6. Predominant Age Group Among Employees

•	Objective: To determine the predominant age group within the company.

•	Findings:

o	The most significant number of employees are in the 20-25 age group (152 employees) and 25-30 age group (182 employees), which together represent the majority of the workforce.
o	Employees aged between 40-45 and 45-50 were the least represented, with only 3 and 0 employees in these groups, respectively.
•	Visualization: 
A stacked bar chart was used to show the age distribution. The stacked nature of the chart made it easy to visualize how the workforce is distributed across different age groups.

9. Highest Salary Expenditure by Team and Position
    
•	Objective: To identify which teams and positions incur the highest salary expenditures.

•	Findings:

o	Position-wise salary expenditure:
	C (Consultants): 466,377,332
	PF (Professional Group): 442,560,850
	PG (Professional Growth): 446,848,971
	SF (Specialist Group): 408,020,976
	SG (Senior Group): 396,976,258
o	Team-wise salary expenditure:
	Atlanta Hawks: 72,902,950
	Boston Celtics: 58,541,068
	Brooklyn Nets: 52,528,475
	Charlotte Hornets: $78,340,920
	Chicago Bulls: 86,783,378
	Other teams such as Los Angeles Clippers and Dallas Mavericks also showed significant salary expenditures.

Visualization: Bar charts were used to show salary expenditures both by team and by position. These visualizations helped highlight the teams and positions where the company is spending the most on salaries.

11. Correlation Between Age and Salary

•	Objective: To explore whether there is a relationship between age and salary.

•	Findings:
o	The analysis revealed a positive correlation between age and salary, with older employees generally earning higher salaries. The 35-40 age group had the highest average salary.

•	Visualization: A scatter plot was created to visualize the relationship between age and salary, reinforcing the finding that, in general, older employees tend to have higher salaries due to increased experience and seniority.

Details on the Visualizations Created

1.	Employee Distribution Across Teams (Pie Chart):
o	This pie chart visually represented the percentage distribution of employees across the 31 teams, helping to understand which teams are larger and which are smaller.

2.	Employee Segregation by Position (Bar Chart):
o	A bar chart showed the number of employees in each position, highlighting the most common and rare positions within the organization.

3.	Predominant Age Group Distribution (Stacked Bar Chart):
o	A stacked bar chart depicted the distribution of employees across different age groups, revealing that the majority of employees are within the 20-30 age range.

4.	Salary Expenditure by Team and Position (Bar Charts):
o	Bar charts were used to display salary expenditures by both team and position. The visualizations clearly demonstrated where the company spends the most on salaries.

5.	Correlation Between Age and Salary (Scatter Plot):
o	The scatter plot showed the relationship between age and salary, confirming that salary tends to increase with age and experience, with the 35-40 age group having the highest average salary.

Conclusion

This project has provided valuable insights into ABC company's workforce. The key findings include:

•	The team distribution shows that some teams have a higher percentage of employees, while others are smaller in size.

•	The segregation of employees by position shows that management and professional roles are most prevalent, with consultant and specialist roles being less common.

•	The age distribution highlights a predominantly young workforce, with the 20-30 age group being the most common.

•	The salary expenditure analysis reveals that both the position and team have significant impacts on salary distribution, with consultants and senior professionals incurring the highest costs.

•	The correlation between age and salary suggests that older employees tend to earn more, which aligns with expectations based on seniority and experience.
